### Certified Kubernetes Application Developer Crash Course (CKAD)

        The ability to use, troubleshoot, and monitor Kubernetes as an application developer is in high demand. 
        In response, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) developed CKAD program to establish credibility 
        and value in the job market. The exam is different from the typical multichoice format of other certifications.
        It’s completely performance based, under immense time pressure, and requires deep knowledge of the tasks.

        CKAD Expert walks you through all the topics covered in the exam to fully prepare you to pass with flying 
        colors.

### What you’ll learn and how you can apply it

#### By the end of this live online course, you’ll understand:

    - When and how to apply Kubernetes concepts to manage an application
    - Objectives, abilities, and tips and tricks to pass the CKAD exam
    - The ins and outs of the kubectl command-line tool
    
####  And you’ll be able to:

      Demonstrate competency performing the responsibilities of Kubernetes application developers
      Solve real-world Kubernetes problems in a hands-on command-line environment
      Navigate and solve questions during the CKAD exam


 #### This Training event is for you because…

    - You’re a developer using Kubernetes to configure, manage, and roll out applications.
