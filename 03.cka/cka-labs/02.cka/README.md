## How it goes


First, it is very useful to redo the now famous "Kubernetes the hard way" by Kelsey Hightower: https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/tree/master/docs

You can also find a similar guide from Linux Academy which explains all the steps: https://linuxacademy.com/course/kubernetes-the-hard-way/

It is not necessary to know how to do it by heart for the CKA, contrary to what we can read online. But it's good training to understand how the Kubernetes system and architecture works in detail.

Then you can repeat exercises similar to the problems you will be asked during the exam. This repo is actually a set of exercises with their solution.
